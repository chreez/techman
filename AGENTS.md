# ADMIN.md

This file governs the behavior of agentic software in this repository.

> 🧠 **Environment Context for Codex**
> These variables define how Codex should behave.
> Codex must not infer or mutate them.

* `$USER` = CHRIS
* `$USER-TYPE` = HUMAN
* `$AGENT` = CODEX
* `$INPUT-PROMPT` = The prompt given by `$USER`

---

```bash
cat .agentic/*
```

---

## 🧠 Rule Types

> 💡 **Rule types are \$USER-defined.**
> Codex never defines new types—it only follows those listed here.

```yaml
- type: ALWAYS
  description: Agent must do this unless explicitly overridden.
  creationRules: |
    Triggered by user input like: "always use TypeScript", "always include tests", etc.

- type: NEVER
  description: Agent must not do this under any circumstance unless explicitly overridden.
  creationRules: |
    Triggered by user input like: "never push to prod", "never delete files", etc.
```

---

## 🗂 Rule Category Creation (`./agentic/${category}.yaml`)

> 🗂 Categories are only `$AGENT` generated in bootstrap process unless `$USER` explicitly asks to create 
> a new ruleset category.

### ✅ Example Categories

* `coding.context.md`
* `docs.context.md`
* `deployment.context.md`$AGENT: 🟡 Remove after bootstrap (cleanup document)
* `testing.context.md`$AGENT: 🟡 Remove after bootstrap (cleanup document)
* `architecture.context.md` $AGENT: 🟡 Remove after bootstrap (cleanup document)
* `safety.context.md`$AGENT: 🟡 Remove after bootstrap (cleanup document)

## 📐 Ruleset Format

```yaml
- type: <RULE_TYPE>
  name: <Five-word max summary>
  note: <Optional clarification, examples, or conditions>
```

## 🧾 Rule Creation and deletion

> ✍️ Rule creation is `$AGENT` defined, triggered by `$USER-INPUT`.

- `$AGENT`evaluates `$USER-INPUT` against rule type `creationRules`.
- `$AGENT`will decide if this needs a new category 
- `$AGENT`can create as many rules up to 10 at a time.
- `$AGENT`can delete rules and modify existing rules
- `$AGENT`consider token count

---

## 🚦 Root Ruleset
> 💬 **Codex Note:** Use this file as the root policy document. Do not inherit or cascade rules across directories.

* Always summarize loaded context before any action.
* Never search for additional `ADMIN.md` files.
* Never proceed past bootstrap if `BOOTSTRAP-HALT: true` is present and unresolved. (remove after bootstrapping)

---

## 🛠 Update Policy

* All `.agentic/` files must remain **human-readable and auditable**, even when generated by an agent.

---

## 📁 Context Files

On prompt start, read all files in the `.agentic/` directory:

---

## 🚧 Bootstrap Prompt (delete after initialization complete)

```
BOOTSTRAP-HALT: true
```

> 🟡 **Start Bootstrap Process**
> Codex must prompt the user of the following before proceeding.
> Goal: define up to **5 initial categories**.
> 🗑️ Delete this section once `.agentic/category.yaml` and `.context.md` files are generated.

### 🔧 Initialization Questions

1. **What are you trying to complete in this project?**

    * [ x ] Build a new web app that's focussed on mobile first. 
    * [ x ] I want to use modern web standards
    * [ x ] Minimalist web standards with user experience as the core tonant.

2. **Which area will $AGENT be most active in?**

    * [ x ] Coding
    * [ x ] Testing
    * [ x ] Architecture

3. **Open Ended - What is your goal?**
    * [ x ] A simple web app that is focussed around Austin, TX events and things to do.
    * [ x ] Eventually the application should take in a criteria from the user and an LLM should determine 
      * Places that are currently open that match that criteria. 
      * [ x ] The website should expose a prompt driven workflow to determine what food place the user should eat at.
    * 

4. **Where does this project primarily run or operate?**
    * [ x ] Web (browser-based)
    * [ x ] Server / backend services
      * Can consider backend architecture at a later point.
      * Plugging in OAUTH access to things like chat gpt for prompt workflow.

5. **How should Codex behave in ambiguous situations?**
    * [ x ] Ask before taking action
      * Lets start with codex always asking one clarifying question to ensure correct experience

6. **Confirm proposed categories before generation.**
   > Codex will summarize up to 5 inferred categories and ask:
   > Codex: Generate categories based on this responses. 

7. **Open Ended - Anything else you'd like to add?**
    
    > $AGENT: loop this until user says "no"
   
    **Example for $USER:**
    > Always define types..
    > Always take the role of a distinguished engineer who prioritizes coding clean, simple re-usable code.
    > Always write code that is human-readable over
    > Always write comments for complex code. 
    
   

### 🔧 Bootstrap prompts complete
- $AGENT: Always create a `project.context.yaml` 
  - containing project goals, current or otherwise
  - containing details of the project
  - enhance this context based on your best judgement
- $AGENT: Always create an `agent-role.context.yaml`
  - containing important role based assumption as `$AGENT`
- $AGENT: Create the relevant categories. 
- $AGENT: Create the starter rulesets in each category.
- $AGENT: Delete the bootstrap section.
- $AGENT: Stop processing.
