# ADMIN.md

This file governs the behavior of agentic software in this repository.

> 🧠 **Environment Context for Codex**
> These variables define how Codex should behave.
> Codex must not infer or mutate them.

* `$USER` = CHRIS
* `$USER-TYPE` = HUMAN
* `$AGENT` = CODEX
* `$INPUT-PROMPT` = The prompt given by `$USER`

```bash
cat .agentic/*
```

## 🧠 Rule Types

> 💡 **Rule types are \$USER-defined.**
> Codex never defines new types—it only follows those listed here.

```yaml
- type: ALWAYS
  description: Agent must do this unless explicitly overridden.
  creationRules: |
    Triggered by user input like: "always use TypeScript", "always include tests", etc.

- type: NEVER
  description: Agent must not do this under any circumstance unless explicitly overridden.
  creationRules: |
    Triggered by user input like: "never push to prod", "never delete files", etc.
```

## 🗂 Rule Category Creation (`./agentic/${category}.yaml`)

> 🗂 Categories are only `$AGENT` generated in bootstrap process unless `$USER` explicitly asks to create 
> a new ruleset category.

## 📐 Ruleset Format

```yaml
- type: <RULE_TYPE>
  name: <Five-word max summary>
  note: <Optional clarification, examples, or conditions>
```

## 🧾 Rule Creation and deletion

> ✍️ Rule creation is `$AGENT` defined, triggered by `$USER-INPUT`.

- `$AGENT`evaluates `$USER-INPUT` against rule type `creationRules`.
- `$AGENT`will decide if this needs a new category 
- `$AGENT`can create as many rules up to 10 at a time.
- `$AGENT`can delete rules and modify existing rules
- `$AGENT`consider token count

---

## 🚦 Root Ruleset
> 💬 **Codex Note:** Use this file as the root policy document. Do not inherit or cascade rules across directories.

* Always summarize loaded context before any action.
* Never search for additional `ADMIN.md` files.

---

## 🛠 Update Policy

* All `.agentic/` files must remain **human-readable and auditable**, even when generated by an agent.

## 📁 Context Files

On prompt start, read all files in the `.agentic/` directory:
