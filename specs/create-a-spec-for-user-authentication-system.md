description: >
  The user authentication system specification outlines a secure and efficient framework for verifying user identities through multi-factor authentication, ensuring only authorized individuals gain access to the system while maintaining user data privacy and compliance with industry standards such as GDPR and CCPA.

## üß† Goal

The main purpose of this specification is to design a robust user authentication system that enhances security by implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) while ensuring a seamless user experience. The objective is to protect sensitive user data, prevent unauthorized access, and comply with regulatory standards.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functionality

- **User Registration**: Allow users to create accounts with email verification.
- **Login**: Enable secure login using username and password, with optional MFA.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Support for SMS, email, and authenticator app-based verification.
- **Password Reset**: Provide a secure mechanism for users to reset forgotten passwords.
- **Account Lockout**: Temporarily lock accounts after multiple failed login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.
- **Session Management**: Implement secure session handling with automatic timeout and logout.
- **Audit Logging**: Record authentication events for monitoring and compliance purposes.

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

- **User Adoption**: Achieve a minimum of 95% user adoption of MFA within the first six months.
- **Security Incidents**: Reduce unauthorized access incidents by 90% compared to the previous system.
- **Compliance**: Ensure 100% compliance with GDPR and CCPA regulations.
- **Performance**: Authentication processes should complete within 2 seconds for 95% of transactions.

## üîê Security

- **Data Encryption**: Use AES-256 encryption for storing sensitive data.
- **Secure Transmission**: Ensure all data is transmitted over HTTPS.
- **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct quarterly security audits to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Access Controls**: Implement role-based access controls to limit administrative privileges.

## üß™ Test Strategy

- **Unit Testing**: Cover all authentication functions with unit tests to ensure correct behavior.
- **Integration Testing**: Test interactions between authentication components and other system parts.
- **Penetration Testing**: Conduct external penetration testing to identify security weaknesses.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Validate the system with real users to ensure usability and satisfaction.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Notes

- **Technology Stack**: Utilize OAuth 2.0 for authorization and OpenID Connect for authentication.
- **Scalability**: Design the system to handle up to 10,000 concurrent users.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Implement daily backups and a disaster recovery plan to ensure data integrity.

## üìù Example Usage

1. **User Registration**: A new user signs up using their email, receives a verification link, and sets up MFA.
2. **Login with MFA**: A user logs in with their credentials and confirms their identity via an authenticator app.
3. **Password Reset**: A user requests a password reset, receives a secure link via email, and sets a new password.
