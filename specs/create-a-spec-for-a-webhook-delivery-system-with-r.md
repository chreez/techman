title: Webhook Delivery System with Retry Logic
status: draft
entry_points:
  - POST /webhooks
  - GET /webhooks/status
description: >
  The webhook delivery system is designed to reliably transmit event notifications to specified endpoints, incorporating retry logic to automatically attempt redelivery in the event of a failure, ensuring successful message delivery even in cases of temporary network issues or endpoint unavailability.

## üß† Goal

The primary objective of this specification is to define a robust webhook delivery system that ensures reliable transmission of event notifications to client-defined endpoints. The system aims to minimize message loss and guarantee delivery through a comprehensive retry mechanism, thereby enhancing the reliability of event-driven architectures.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functionality

- **Event Notification Delivery**: Transmit event notifications to specified HTTP endpoints.
- **Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff strategy for retrying failed deliveries, with a maximum of 5 retries.
- **Status Monitoring**: Provide endpoints to check the status of webhook deliveries, including success, failure, and retry attempts.
- **Configurable Timeouts**: Allow configuration of request timeouts and retry intervals.
- **Security**: Support for HTTPS and basic authentication to ensure secure transmission of data.
- **Logging**: Detailed logging of delivery attempts, including timestamps, status codes, and error messages.

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

- **Delivery Success Rate**: Achieve a minimum of 99.9% successful delivery rate for all webhook events.
- **Retry Efficiency**: Ensure that 95% of initially failed deliveries are successfully retried within the first three attempts.
- **Latency**: Maintain an average delivery latency of less than 500ms for successful transmissions.
- **Error Reporting**: Provide comprehensive error logs for 100% of failed delivery attempts.

## üîê Security

- **Data Encryption**: All data transmitted must be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.
- **Authentication**: Endpoints must support basic authentication to verify the identity of the sender.
- **Access Control**: Implement IP whitelisting to restrict access to known, trusted sources.
- **Audit Logging**: Maintain an audit log of all access and delivery attempts for compliance and troubleshooting.

## üß™ Test Strategy

- **Unit Testing**: Cover all core functionalities, including delivery, retry logic, and status monitoring.
- **Integration Testing**: Test interactions with external endpoints and verify security measures.
- **Load Testing**: Simulate high-volume traffic to ensure system stability and performance under load.
- **Failure Scenarios**: Test retry logic by simulating network failures and endpoint unavailability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Notes

- Use a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ) to manage delivery attempts and retries.
- Implement exponential backoff using a configurable delay multiplier.
- Ensure idempotency by including unique identifiers in each webhook payload.
- Utilize a centralized logging service (e.g., ELK Stack) for monitoring and troubleshooting.

## üìù Example Usage

1. **Register a Webhook Endpoint**:
   ```http
   POST /webhooks
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "url": "https://example.com/endpoint",
     "events": ["order.created", "order.shipped"],
     "auth": {
       "type": "basic",
       "username": "user",
       "password": "pass"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Check Webhook Status**:
   ```http
   GET /webhooks/status?event_id=12345
   ```

   Response:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "delivered",
     "attempts": 3,
     "last_attempt": "2025-07-16T12:34:56Z"
   }
   ```
