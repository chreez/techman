title: Spec Validator CLI (Bash)
status: draft
entry_points:
  - bin/spec-validator
  - scripts/spec-validate.sh  
  - run via: ./bin/spec-validator path/to/spec.md

description: >
  Defines a Bash-based CLI tool that validates a spec file against the core spec-validator logic. Designed for lightweight execution using Claude or OpenAI APIs and basic shell utilities.

---

## 🧠 Goal

Enable fast, local spec validation through a CLI wrapper that leverages remote LLMs and shell parsing. Supports Markdown spec files and produces structured validation output for downstream agents.

## ⚙️ Functionality
  - Accepts .md (with frontmatter) and .yaml spec files
  - Detects and uses one of:
    - OPENAI_API_KEY
    - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
  - Sends content + spec-validator.md to LLM
  - Receives structured PASS | WARN | FAIL + recommendations (JSON)
  - Handles LLM responses that may include markdown code blocks
  - Optionally saves to disk or pipes to next tool
  - Accepts git diff (via stdin or file) to focus validation scope
  - ⚠️ Only applies validation to diff content within recognized spec files
  - Uses local context:
    - The spec file itself
    - Git diff (optional)
    - promptTemplate-GPT.sh as system instruction
    - Hardcoded reference spec: ../specs/spec-validator.md (relative to script location)
  - Returns metadata including model_used in output
  - Gracefully handles API-model mismatches (e.g., Claude models with OpenAI API)

## ✅ Success Criteria
  • CLI runs without error given valid API key and input file
  • Returns results in JSON or human-readable format
  • Fails gracefully with error output if file is invalid or model API fails
  • Ignores non-spec diffs when parsing git diff
  • Agent can use tool by piping staged spec changes:

```bash
git diff --cached specs/ | ./bin/spec-validator --diff - > result.json
```

## 📤 Output Format

### Human-Readable Default (stdout)

```text
[VALIDATION] path/to/spec.md
Status: FAIL
Model Used: claude-4-sonnet

Failures (requires human review):
- Line 5: Missing `version` field in frontmatter — critical metadata incomplete.

Warnings (agent-fixable):
- Line 17: Vague use of "aligned values" — refine for clarity.

Suggestions:
- [FAIL] Add a version field to the frontmatter.
- [WARN] Clarify "aligned values" with an explicit definition.

Clarifying Questions:
- What does "aligned values" refer to in your domain? Provide examples.

Summary:
PASS: 7 | WARN: 1 | FAIL: 1
```

### JSON Output (--json)

```json
{
  "status": "FAIL",
  "model_used": "claude-4-sonnet",
  "summary": {
    "pass": 7,
    "warn": 1,
    "fail": 1
  },
  "failures": [
    {
      "line": 5,
      "message": "Missing `version` field in frontmatter — critical metadata incomplete."
    }
  ],
  "warnings": [
    {
      "line": 17,
      "message": "Vague use of 'aligned values' — refine for clarity."
    }
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "level": "FAIL",
      "text": "Add a version field to the frontmatter."
    },
    {
      "level": "WARN",
      "text": "Clarify 'aligned values' with an explicit definition."
    }
  ],
  "clarifying_questions": [
    "What does 'aligned values' refer to in your domain? Provide examples."
  ]
}
```

## 🔐 Security
  • Never logs API keys
  • Accepts input from safe file paths only

## 🧪 Test Strategy

Manual tests via example specs:

```bash
./bin/spec-validator specs/example.md > result.json
cat result.json | jq
```

or with diff input:

```bash
git diff HEAD^ HEAD -- specs/ | ./bin/spec-validator --diff -
```

## 🛠️ Implementation Notes

### JSON Escaping in Shell
- Use temporary files with heredocs for complex JSON payloads
- Escape prompt content using `jq -Rs .` to handle newlines and special characters
- Avoid inline JSON strings with shell variable interpolation

### API Response Handling  
- Strip markdown code blocks (```json) from LLM responses before parsing
- Use sed or similar to clean: `sed -e 's/^```json//' -e 's/^```//' -e 's/```$//'`
- Provide fallback JSON structure for parse failures

### Model Selection
- Check API type before attempting model calls
- Skip Claude models when using OpenAI API key and vice versa
- Continue to next model in preference list on failure

### Path Resolution
- Use `$(dirname "$0")/../specs/` for relative path resolution
- Ensures spec validator finds reference files regardless of working directory
