status: draft

description: >
  The specification outlines the implementation of an API rate limiting mechanism using a sliding window algorithm, designed to efficiently control the number of requests a user can make within a specified time frame by dynamically adjusting the window based on request timestamps, ensuring fair usage and preventing server overload.
---

## 🧠 Goal

The primary objective of this specification is to implement a robust API rate limiting system using a sliding window algorithm. This system aims to manage and restrict the number of API requests a user can make within a specified time interval, thereby ensuring fair resource allocation, preventing abuse, and maintaining optimal server performance.

## ⚙️ Functionality

- **Dynamic Window Adjustment**: Adjusts the time window dynamically based on incoming request timestamps to provide a more flexible rate limiting approach.
- **Request Counting**: Accurately counts the number of requests made by a user within the current sliding window.
- **Threshold Enforcement**: Enforces a predefined request threshold, denying requests that exceed this limit within the window.
- **User Identification**: Utilizes user-specific identifiers (e.g., API keys, IP addresses) to apply rate limits on a per-user basis.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Provides logging of rate limit events and monitoring capabilities for system administrators to track usage patterns.

## ✅ Success Criteria

- **Accuracy**: The system accurately tracks and limits requests according to the defined rate limit thresholds.
- **Performance**: Minimal impact on API response times, ensuring that the rate limiting mechanism operates efficiently under high load.
- **Scalability**: Capable of handling increased traffic without degradation in performance or accuracy.
- **User Feedback**: Provides clear feedback to users when they exceed their rate limits, including appropriate HTTP status codes and messages.

## 🔐 Security

- **Data Protection**: Ensure that user identifiers and request data are securely stored and transmitted.
- **Abuse Prevention**: Implement mechanisms to detect and mitigate attempts to bypass rate limits, such as IP spoofing.
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to rate limit configuration and monitoring tools to authorized personnel only.

## 🧪 Test Strategy

- **Unit Testing**: Develop unit tests to verify the correctness of the sliding window algorithm and request counting logic.
- **Load Testing**: Conduct load tests to assess the system's performance under high traffic conditions and ensure scalability.
- **Integration Testing**: Test the rate limiting mechanism within the context of the entire API to validate end-to-end functionality.
- **Security Testing**: Perform security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities related to rate limiting.

## 🛠️ Implementation Notes

- **Algorithm Choice**: The sliding window algorithm is chosen for its ability to provide a smooth rate limiting experience compared to fixed window algorithms.
- **Data Storage**: Consider using a high-performance in-memory data store (e.g., Redis) to store request counts and timestamps for quick access.
- **Configuration**: Allow for configurable rate limits and window sizes to accommodate different API usage patterns and requirements.

## 📝 Example Usage

- **Scenario**: A user with API key `abc123` makes requests to the `/api/v1/resource` endpoint.
  - **Request 1**: Within limit, processed successfully.
  - **Request 2**: Within limit, processed successfully.
  - **Request 3**: Exceeds limit, receives HTTP 429 status with message "Rate limit exceeded. Try again later."
